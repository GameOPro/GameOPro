## Hi there 👋
I exist. I think

I do Computer Science.

If my website doesnt work its because I set it to only allow my own ip only (until I upgrade my server and get a switch+firewall).

I also don't post on social media.

Discord is the same as my github username (GameOPro) if you want to add me or something
